## What is NoSQL?

`NoSQL`, short for "Not Only SQL" or "non-relational", is a category of database
management systems that differ from traditional relational databases in their
approach to data storage and retrieval. Here's a rundown of its key characteristics:

**Data Storage:**

- _No rigid schema_: Unlike relational databases with predefined tables and columns,
  NoSQL databases offer flexible data structures like documents, key-value pairs,
  or graphs. Data can evolve organically without schema modifications.
- _Scalability_: NoSQL databases excel at horizontal scaling, where additional
  servers are added to handle increasing data volume and user requests.
- _Distributed architecture_: Data is distributed across multiple servers,
  promoting fault tolerance and improving performance.

**Data Retrieval:**

- _Non-SQL query language_: Each NoSQL type employs its own query language, distinct
  from SQL use in relational databases. Some languages are more expressive than
  others, focusing on specific data models.
- _Flexible querying_: NoSQL databases prioritize adaptability and allow querying
  based on various data attributes and structures.

**Use Cases:**

- _Big data_: NoSQL databases are ideal for storing and processing massive datasets
  efficiently, making them popular for analysis, real-time applications, and large-
  scale web services.
- _Unstructured_ data: NoSQL databases handle unstructured and semi-structured data
  efficiently, such as social media posts, senor readings, and log files.
- _High availability_: Distributed and fault-tolerant architecture ensures uninterrupted
  data access even if individual servers fail.

**Popular NoSQL Types:**

- Document databases (MongoDB, Couchbase)
- Key-value stores (Redis, Cassandra)
- Wide-column stores (Amazon DynamoDB, HBase)
- Graph databases (Neo4j, OrientDB)

**Pros and Cons:**

Pros:

- Scalability and flexibility
- Efficiently and unstructured data
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Simpler schema design and data modification

Cons:

- No standardized query language
- Potential for data consistency issues in some types
- May require additional expertise for query optimization and data management

## State the difference between WHERE and HAVING in SQL?

WHERE:

- Filters individual rows before grouping and aggregation.
- Operates on individual rows within tables.
- Typically used with SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.

HAVING:

- Filters groups of rows after aggregation.
- Operates on the results of aggregate functions (like SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- Used exclusively with the GROUP BY clause.

Key Difference:

- Timing: WHERE files before grouping, HAVING filters after grouping.
- Scope: WHERE works in individual rows, HAVING works on aggregated results.
- Usage: WHERE can be sued with various statements, HAVING only with GROUP BY.

When to Use Each:

- Use WHERE to filter rows based on specific conditions before aggregation.
- Use HAVING to filter groups of rows based on aggregate values after aggregation.

## How is DROP Different from TRUNCATE?

DROP:

- Definition: Removes the table definition and all its data permanently.
- Operation: Deletes the table from the database schema, freeing up the associated
  storage space.
- Impact: Once data is dropped, it's unrecoverable. Use with caution!
- Use cases: Removing unused or unwanted tables, restructuring the database schema.

TRUNCATE:

- Definition: Removes all rows from a table, leaving the table definition intact.
- Operation: Empties the table but retains the table structure and allocated storage
  space.
- Impact: Data is gone, but the table still exists and can be populated again.
- Use cases: Resetting test data, clearing temporary tables, quickly removing bulk
  data.

## What is the difference between PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY?

Both **PRIMARY KEY** and **FOREIGN KEY** play crucial roles in data integrity and relationships
between tables. However, they serve distinct purposes:

**PRIMARY KEY:**

- _Unique identifier_: Uniquely identifies each rows within a table. No two rows can
  have the same value for the primary key columns.
- _Enforces data integrity_: Prevents duplicate entries and ensure consistent identification
  of rows.
- _Typically a single column or a combination of columns_: Offers optimal performance
  for data retrieval and joins.
- _Can't be NULL_: Every row must have a defined value for the primary key.

**FOREIGN KEY:**

- _References another table's primary key:_ Creates a link between two tables, ensuring
  data consistency across them.
- _Maintains referential integrity_: Prevents orphaned rows in the referencing table
  by ensuring referenced rows exist in the referenced table.
- _Can be a single column or combination of columns_: Must match the referenced
  tables's primary key structure.
- _Can be NULL_: Allows for optional associations or incomplete data in the referencing
  table.

## What is the difference between PRIMARY KEY and UNION?

| Feature        | PRIMARY KEY                           | UNION                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose        | Data integrity, unique identification | Combing data sets                             |
| Scope          | Within a single table                 | Across multiple tables or queries             |
| Uniqueness     | Enforces unique rows                  | Removes duplicate rows in the combined result |
| Data structure | Specific columns define the key       | Flexible, based on query results              |
| Null Values    | NOt allowed                           | Allowed in some UNION variables               |

## What is a check constraint in SQL?

The check constraint is used to limit the values that can be inserted into a column.

## Given 2 tables A and B, write a query to fetch values in table B that are not present in A
